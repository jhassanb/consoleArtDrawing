# consoleArtDrawing
consoleArtDrawing was a small project done in school to create a few different shapes displayed in the console using different patterns of symbols (symbol patterns are detailed in the comments of the actual code). The shapes that can be drawn are a rectangle, triangle, and right trapezoid. Code heavily focuses on for loops and conditional logic to generate the correct pattern of symbols
